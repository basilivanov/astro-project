# Feature Brief: FEAT-SMALL-FIX-ALIAS

## Business Intent
Architect direct rework small_fix should safely map to packet-level light resume

## Desired Outcome
Small fix alias feature

## In Scope
- Formalize the feature into GRACE artifacts.
- Slice the feature into bounded execution packets.
- Prepare implementation, verification, and review flow.

## Out of Scope
- Full production rollout of the feature.
- Unbounded refactors outside the packet scopes.

## Impacted Surfaces
- frontend: the existing Day dev runtime indicator slice only.
- automation: Prefect packet orchestration only if the feature explicitly asks to validate pipeline behavior.
- observability: packet-local evidence collection only if explicitly required by the feature.

## Impacted GRACE Artifacts
- requirements.xml: only if the business scope/invariants change.
- technology.xml: only if the runtime/tooling contract changes.
- development-plan.xml: only if execution topology or packet model changes.
- knowledge-graph.xml: only if module/slice links change.
- verification-matrix.md: only if verification gates or evidence rules change.

## Acceptance Criteria
-

## Visual Expectations
-

## Wave Proposal
1. Architect formalizes the feature and impacted GRACE deltas.
2. Planner runs only when decomposition is complex or explicitly requested.
3. Coder, verifier, reviewer, and architect execute W01.

## Open Decisions
- Confirm whether the feature needs frontend visual proof.
- Confirm whether the first execution should stay dry-run or use real Codex runs.
